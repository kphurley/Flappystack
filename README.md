## Requirements
- Built using Unity 5.4.0, although it's possible older versions will work
- Currently the resolution is forced at 768x1024.  Retina MacBook users will want to
set their display property to scaled -> more space to see the entire game window.

## Building the Project
- Download Unity and make a free account. [Unity 3D Link] (https://unity3d.com/)
- Clone this repo with `git clone`
- Open Unity, and in the initial starting screen, browse the Flappystack repo
- Unity will build the project and you're off and running!

(Note - when I rebuilt this on my machine the score text was misplaced...Consider that your first challenge to correct!)
